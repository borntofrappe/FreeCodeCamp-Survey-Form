## The task 

> Build a survey form in which visitors can leave feedback on a certain subject.

> Project part of the FreeCodeCamp Beta curriculum: Applied Responsive Web Design Projects.

The purpose of this repository is to fulfill a challenge for the [Beta Curriculum](beta.freecodecamp.org) on FreeCodeCamp, namely building a **Survey Form** in which visitors can fill in their own information.

A project resembling [this one](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/VPaoNP). A project fulfilling multiple conditions.

In particular, there ought to exist:

1. a title in between `h1` tags with `id="title"`;
2. a short explanation in between `p` tags with `id="description"`;
3. a `form` tag with `id="survey-form"`, which nests multiple elements.

  Multiple items among which:

  - a name field with `id="name"`
  - an email field with `id="email"` (accepting valid email addresses)
  - a number field with `id="number"` (accepting only numbers, in a range)

    For all input fields, there should be also a `label`, describing the respective elements. Each label should also have an appropriate id(s): `"name-label"`, `"email-label"`, `"number-label"`.

    Moreover, all input elements should contain `placeholder` text, hinting at the respectively accepted values.

  - a dropdown input with `id="dropdown"`
  - a menu consisting of `radio` buttons, with the same `name` attribute;
  - a menu consisting of `checkbox`es, with the same `name` attribute;
  - a `textarea` element, for additional comments;
  - a submit `button` with `id="submit"`.


There is not much space left for imagination in the creation of the project, but it is something which can be accepted for the nature of the task itself. A survey form should mostly retain standard practices to fulfill its purpose with the least amount of friction. Functionality overwhelms aesthetics and imaginative designs in this regard.

That being said, stylistic choices are still required for a readable font and color palette.
